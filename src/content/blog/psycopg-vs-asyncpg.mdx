Nowadays, everyone talks about performance and how to make our applications faster, and one key factor is how we interact with our databases.
Sometimes we get overwhelmed by small but important decisions, like choosing the right library to work with our database.
Asking ourselves questions like: _"Should I use an ORM or a query builder?"_, _"Should I use a sync or async library?"_ or
_"Is this one faster than the other one?"_.
I know, it's a lot of questions, but don't worry, I'm here to help you with one of those questions.

In the Python world, we have a lot of libraries to work with PostgreSQL, but two of the most popular are Psycopg 3 (Psycopg) and Asyncpg.
In this article, we will compare these two libraries and see which one is better for your project.

## Setup

We will use a simple [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (v0.109.2) application with some endpoints that will interact with a
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v16) database running in a Docker container.

For connecting with the database, we will use two different libraries: [Psycopg 3](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/) (v3.1.18)
and [Asyncpg](https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/#) (v0.29.0).

## Benchmarks

To evaluate the performance of the Psycopg 3 and Asyncpg libraries in handling various loads, we performed four different tests.
Each test focused on reading a different number of rows, and comparing the performance between **Psycopg sync**, **Psycopg async** and **Asyncpg**.

The tests were performed using the [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk?tab=readme-ov-file) tool, with the same number of
requests, threads and duration for each test:

* Threads: 12
* Connections: 400 (total number of HTTP connections to keep open with each thread handling `N = connections/threads`)
* Duration: 2m

## Conclusions

In this benchmark study, we sought to unravel the performance characteristics of two prominent Python libraries, Psycopg 3 and Asyncpg,
when interacting with a PostgreSQL database in the context of a FastAPI application. Through a series of tests involving
the retrieval of 50, 250, 1000, and 5000 rows from the database, we gained valuable insights into the behaviors of both
synchronous and asynchronous connectors.

#### Psycopg sync connector

The synchronous implementation of Psycopg 3 exhibited commendable performance across all test scenarios. However, as
the volume of rows to be retrieved increased, a gradual increase in latency was observed. This indicates that while
Psycopg's synchronous connector is robust, it may face challenges in handling larger datasets efficiently.

#### Psycopg async connector

The asynchronous counterpart of Psycopg 3 showcased improved responsiveness, particularly evident in scenarios with larger
datasets. The reduction in latency and notable increase in requests per second make the asynchronous implementation a
favorable choice for applications requiring enhanced scalability and responsiveness during database interactions.
Async Psycopg demonstrates a tendency to better handle a larger number of rows, showcasing its potential for scenarios with increased data loads.

#### Asyncpg async connector

Asyncpg, a dedicated asynchronous library, emerged as the top performer in this benchmark. It consistently demonstrated
low latency and high-request throughput across all test cases. Its asynchronous nature proved especially advantageous
when dealing with increased data loads, solidifying its position as an optimal choice for projects demanding peak
performance in asynchronous database operations.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Scalability Matters:** As the dataset size grows, the choice of an asynchronous connector becomes increasingly critical.
  Asynchronous implementation shines in scenarios with larger datasets, offering superior performance compared to synchronous alternatives.
2. **Application-Specific Considerations:** The selection between Psycopg and Asyncpg should be guided by the specific
  requirements of your application. While Psycopg, both synchronous and asynchronous, presents robust performance,
  Asyncpg stands out when it comes to handling increased concurrency and larger data volumes.
3. **Async Psycopg for Larger Datasets:** The benchmark results suggest that Async Psycopg exhibits a tendency to better
handle a larger number of rows, making it a promising choice for scenarios with extensive data retrieval requirements.
4. **Paginate Database Queries:** To avoid potential scenarios where a single request could block the entire database,
it is advisable to implement pagination for database queries. This ensures efficient data retrieval without risking performance bottlenecks.

In conclusion, the choice between Psycopg 3 and Asyncpg should be tailored to the unique demands of your project.
By aligning your selection with the scale, concurrency, and responsiveness requirements of your application and implementing
best practices like query pagination, you can ensure optimal performance in database interactions, setting the foundation
for a fast and efficient FastAPI application.
