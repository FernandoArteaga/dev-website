When working with Kubernetes (k8s), it is always a good idea to have a local cluster to test and develop your applications.
There are several tools to create a local k8s cluster, such as [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), [K3s](https://k3s.io/), or [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

But we are going to focus on Kind, a tool that allows you to create a Kubernetes cluster in seconds.

## What is Kind?

Kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes". It was primarily designed for
testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

## Source code

You can find the source code for this article in the [fernandoarteaga/learn-devops](https://github.com/FernandoArteaga/learn-devops) repository on GitHub.

## Setup

We'll be deploying a simple Astro application to our Kind cluster. Yep, that simple ðŸ˜ƒ!

You can follow the instructions in the [fernandoarteaga/learn-devops](https://github.com/FernandoArteaga/learn-devops/blob/main/kubernetes/README.md) repository to deploy the application to your Kind cluster.

The only thing you need to do before, is to install Kind on your local machine. You can find the installation instructions in the [official Kind documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation).
